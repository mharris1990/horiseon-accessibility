# Horiseon Accessibility Project

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to create an accessible web page for a company (Horiseon). I built this project to show how accessible code looks and functions. It solves issues with accessability in the initial starter code and creats a more inclusive environment for the company by allowing others to easily access their web page.

## Installation

In order to make the code more accessable, I combined classes with the same attributes (font size/family/color, image size, etc.) by adding them on the same line using commas. For example, the classes "benefit-brand", "benefit-cost", and "benefit-lead" were all on different lines, but had the same margin and color. 

I combined them as
.benefit-lead, .benefit-cost, .benefit-brand
within the CSS class area.
