# Horiseon Accessibility Project

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to create an accessible web page for a company (Horiseon). I built this project to show how accessible code looks and functions. It solves issues with accessability in the initial starter code and creats a more inclusive environment for the company by allowing others to easily access their web page.
